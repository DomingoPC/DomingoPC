## Hi there, I'm Domingo 👋

🔭 Currently working on: Recommender Systems with PySpark.

+ Creating personal documentation on Content-Based Recommender Systems (CBRS) and Collaborative-Filtering Recommender Systems (CFRS).
+ Several approaches for different inputs (text, tokens, etc.).
+ Implementation with **PySpark**.
+ Handling cache for real time responses.
+ Advantages and disadvantages of different methods from a web-service point of view.

🔭 Also working on: Building Machine Learning Models From Scratch.

- ✔️ Simple Linear Regression Model
- ✔️ Multivariate Regression Model
- ✔️ Logistic Regression: multivariate, but only 2 classes in target variable
- ✔️ Multinomial Logistic Regression: multivariate and multiple classes in target variable
- ✔️ Regularization Techniques: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic-Net
- ✔️ Gradient Descent Optimization: batch size modifications, momentum and adaptive methods
- 🔲 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🔲 Neural Network


📝 Side Projects:

+ Simulations with Python (SimPy) and R (simmer), and visualization (animated plots and PyGame).
+ AI bot to summarize Data Science news.
+ Image-to-Text business notes taken by hand for further processing.
